acamprosate	Acamprosate, sold under the brand name Campral, is a medication used along with counselling to treat alcohol use disorder. Acamprosate is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal. When used alone, acamprosate is not an effective therapy for alcohol use disorder in most individuals (PMID 26084940). Decreasing glutamate activity and increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action	Allergic reactions, abnormal heart rhythms, and low or high blood pressure	In CT (NCT00655967) was shown to be safety in eldery group. There are some reports that in eldery patients may lead to extrapyramidal symptoms, related to decreasing of the  dopamine levels in the ventral tegmental area (PMID: 25191510).	Decreasing glutamate activity and increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action	low
allopurinol	Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) and is an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is a medication used to decrease high blood uric acid levels. It is specifically used to prevent gout, prevent specific types of kidney stones and for the high uric acid levels (PMID 16507884). 		Allopurinol has been shown to improve endothelial function in chronic heart failure (PMID: 17130343 ). Allopurinol initiation was associated with an 11 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with non-initiators in hyperuricemic patients, and a 19 percent lower risk of mortality in gout patients (http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-205269; PMID: 35073156). Long term high dose allopurinol may be associated with a better mortality than long term low dose allopurinol in patients with CHF because of a dose related beneficial effect of allopurinol against the well described adverse effect of urate (PMID: 11847159). 		average
bupropion	Antidepressant, bupropion is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and antagonist of several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Bupropion, sold under the brand names Wellbutrin and Zyban among others, is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support smoking cessation. Also used in obesity treatment.	Rare but serious side effects include seizure, liver toxicity, psychosis, and risk of overdose.	No data	No data	low
carbamazepine	Anticonvulsant; is a sodium channel blocker. Carbamazepine (CBZ), sold under the trade name Tegretol among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.				low
imatinib	Anti-cancer. Imatinib, sold under the brand names Gleevec and Glivec (both marketed worldwide by Novartis) among others, is an oral chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that are Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+), certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome.				
liraglutide	Liraglutide (brand   Victoza ) Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA). GLP-1RAs comprise a class of peptides that bind and activate receptors for the endogenous incretin hormone GLP-1. They potentiate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner to lower blood glucose. Anti-diabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, obesity, and chronic weight management.	May increase the heart rate of T2DM patients (PMID: 33071241)	In a perspective case series study liraglutide shown efficacy in treatment obesity in elderly, fat loss and safety in order to prevent sarcopenia (PMID: 26749118). Lira added to insulin therapy may improve the quality of life in elderly T2D patients undergoing insulin therapy (PMID: 30815572). Multiple rodent studies show, that Liraglutide ameliorates cognitive dysfunction: improved the cognitive function of diabetic mice (PMID: 33298623), alleviates cognitive deficit (PMID: 34507632; PMID: 34507632). May have positive effect in Alzheimer disease treatment (PMID: 34118986) 	Downregulates receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE), associated with fibrosis, inflammation, cognition decline	average
metformin	Antidiabetic drug; insulin-sensitizer. Metformin is a biguanide oral hypoglycemic used primarily for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Evidence suggests that, in addition to improving glycemic control, metformin is associated with improved all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and decreased risk of some cancers. (PMID: 28121088). Metformin is used to treat the following conditions: Diabetes, Type 2; Diabetes, Type 3c (off-label); Female Infertility (off-label); Insulin Resistance Syndrome (off-label); Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (off-label).	May cause lactat-acidosis; mitochondrial dysfunction; several studies have reported that the chronic use of metformin results in vitamin B12 deficiency, affecting between 6 and 30% of users. 	A systematic review and meta-analysis data: the use of metformin results in a reduction of all-cause mortality associated with diseases that accelerate aging, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Metformin use leads to weight reduction, reduces HbA1c; metformin also lowers the atherosclerotic burden in non-diabetic persons at risk of developing T2DM (PMID: 34421827). The addition of metformin to the diet can delay aging and increase life span in both C. elegans and rodents (PMID: 23540700; PMID: 24889636)	activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK); mTOR inhibition; mitohormesis; Complex I inhibition;	strong
pioglitazone	Anti-diabetic drug; insuli-sensitizer; is in the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class. Pioglitazone is used to lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes either alone or in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin.		A retrospective analysis of the effects of the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone (Pio) on longevity showed decreased mortality in patients receiving Pio compared to those receiving a PPARγ-independent insulin secretagogue glimepiride. Taken together, these data suggest the possibility of using PPARγ agonists to promote healthy aging and extend lifespan (PMID: 33219735). Pioglitazone is effective therapy for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (PMID: 15012171). Rodent models: attenuates aging-related disorders (reduced atherosclerosis, hepatic steatosis, renal aging and skin atrophy) in aged apolipoprotein E deficient mice (PMID: 29221940).	activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) 	strong
rivastigmine	Rivastigmine (sold under the trade name Exelon among others) is a dual inhibitor of both acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of acetylcholine, used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The drug can be administered orally or via a transdermal patch (PMID: 29492246).		A number of large, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials have demonstrated that the use of rivastigmine results in significant improvements in cognitive, functional and global performances of AD patients (PMID: 18516265). Long-term rivastigmine treatment increases all-cause mortality in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (PMID: 29742912). It was recently shown, that rivastigmine modifies the α-secretase pathway and potentially early Alzheimer’s disease, so is a disease-modifying intervention that goes beyond symptomatic treatment for AD (PMID: 32066688).		average
